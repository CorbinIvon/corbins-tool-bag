sudo ip route add [network im looking for (local domain)] via [through what means (gateway)]
sudo ip route add [range 255].[range 255].[range 255].0/24 via [target]
sudo ip route add [container destination] via [server-ip]
sudo ip route add 10.122.0.0/24 via 192.168.1.128

This allowed me to connect to the container directly and ping 10.122.0.1. 
It's jumping through the 192.168.1.128 server.
